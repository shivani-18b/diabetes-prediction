#Diabetes Prediction ML Project

This is a Machine Learning project developed as part of my learning in AI/ML during my engineering internship. The goal is to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical parameters.

##Problem Statement
-Diabetes is a common health condition, and early detection can help prevent complications.
-This project uses ML to predict diabetes using patient data.

##Dataset
-PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset
-Loaded directly from a URL in Python

##Algorithm Used
-Logistic Regression to train and predict diabetes

##Steps Implemented
1. Load dataset using Pandas
2. Replace zeros in certain columns with NaN and fill missing values with mean
3. Apply feature scaling using StandardScaler
4. Split dataset into training and testing sets
5. Train the Logistic Regression model (Model Training)
6. Evaluate the model using accuracy and confusion matrix (Model Evaluation)
7. Predict diabetes from user input

##Technologies Used
-Python
-Pandas
-NumPy
-Scikit-learn

##Model Evaluation
-Accuracy Score
-Confusion Matrix

##Sample Usage
-The user is prompted to enter patient details
-The model predicts whether the patient is DIABETIC or NOT DIABETIC.

##Learning Outcome
-Understood the importance of data preprocessing and handling missing data
-Learned to scale features for better model performance
-Gained practical experience with Logistic Regression
-Learned to evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
